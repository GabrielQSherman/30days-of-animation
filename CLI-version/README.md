# Command Line Chess

This Chess application was made to play with two human players. 
Players take turns back and forth first selecting a piece, and then their desired move.
The CLI version does not currently have check/checkmate implementation so the game ends when the players decide the game is over. 
It is possible in this version for the king to move itself into check, there is also no castle or piece swaping implementation so this is just the basics.

I developed this program in the IntelliJ IDE and play the game through the command-line. If you would like to try it out yourself you can use the .zip file in this directory.
The project was exported to zip for IntelliJ but can stil work from any command line or IDE presumably. The auto clearing feature has only been tested in IntelliJ.
Feel free to use this code for whatever you'd like. I made this purley as a learning excercise that was fun and enjoyable to create.
